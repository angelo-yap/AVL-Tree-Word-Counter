# AVL-Tree-Word-Counter
A simple word counter that takes in a text file (tiny_shakespeare.txt) and when lst.printstatistics() is called, prints out the number of different words, total number of words,
most frequent word, and number of singletons.

Here is an example output:
Number of different words: 25670 
Total number of words: 202651 
Most frequent word: the 5437 
Number of singletons: 14919 (58%)
